# Introction to Data Assimilation

The plan is to create several Pluto notebooks that interactively explain aspects of data-assimilation.

## First things first: Pluto

Pluto is a notebook system for Julia. Don't worry, there will not be any real programming involved (unless you want to).
The [website of Pluto](https://plutojl.org/) and scroll down a bit to the installation part.

## First example - 4D-VAR

To run the notebook by opening the file directly from github by copy ing this URL into the open textbox
`https://github.com/robot144/IntroDataAssimilation/blob/main/notebook_4dvar.jl`.
Then run the notebook. First it will install any missing packages, which may take a while. After this, it should be much faster.
Alternatively, you can download this repository and work with the local files.
